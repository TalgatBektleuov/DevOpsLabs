## Why Django?
### 1. Intelligent application development capabilities
#### Django is a core solution in various internet of things (IoT) applications. It is preferred by developers working on Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and IoT algorithms. 
### 2. Versatility and scalability
#### Django can help even the busiest sites to meet the demands of higher traffic, hence improving scalability. Django’s versatility is evident from the fact that it is used in various industries and applications including content management, scientific computing, intelligent automation, and even enterprise management. 
### 3. Faster development
#### Django enables faster application development. Developers can thus utilize it to rapidly create Minimum Viable Products (MVP) and get an early-mover advantage over the competitors.
### 4. Flexibility 
#### Since Django is Python-based which is a versatile programming language, it provides more flexibility and dynamism. The framework can be configured quickly to match specific needs.
### 5. Security 
#### Made by the world’s best web developers, this framework leaves a very small possibility of security loopholes. It also includes prevention of common attacks like SQL injections and cross-site request forgery.
