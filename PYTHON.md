# 1. Best Practices
* Production Ready Web Framework Django
* Use PyFlakes linter for detecting issues in the code 
# 2. Why Django?
## Pros
### 1. Intelligent application development capabilities
Django is a core solution in various internet of things (IoT) applications. It is preferred by developers working on Machine Learning (ML), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and IoT algorithms. 
### 2. Versatility and scalability
Django can help even the busiest sites to meet the demands of higher traffic, hence improving scalability. Django’s versatility is evident from the fact that it is used in various industries and applications including content management, scientific computing, intelligent automation, and even enterprise management. 
### 3. Faster development
Django enables faster application development. Developers can thus utilize it to rapidly create Minimum Viable Products (MVP) and get an early-mover advantage over the competitors.
### 4. Flexibility 
Since Django is Python-based which is a versatile programming language, it provides more flexibility and dynamism. The framework can be configured quickly to match specific needs.
### 5. Security 
Made by the world’s best web developers, this framework leaves a very small possibility of security loopholes. It also includes prevention of common attacks like SQL injections and cross-site request forgery.

## Cons
### Lack of conventions 
A big reason why many programmers dislike Django is that it lacks conventions. As opposed to other frameworks like Ruby on Rails, everything needs to be explicitly defined in Django. This leads to configuration boilerplate and, therefore, a slowed development process. It makes it difficult for developers who are used to working with frameworks with convention over configuration.
### Monolithic nature
The monolithic nature of Django can be a feature for some programmers but for most, it is a drawback. Django has a certain set of files and predefined variables that programmers need to learn before creating any project. The framework has a certain way of performing tasks.

Although it is easy to learn, its mandatory nature means that developers cannot use their own file structure. One needs to follow those rules to deploy anything using Django.
### Not suitable for smaller projects
The Django web framework comes with lots of code that takes the server’s processing and time. This can take its toll on low-end websites that run on very little bandwidth. That is why it is not suitable for projects and products with only a few features and requirements.
### Inability to simultaneously handle multiple requests
Unlike many modern web frameworks, Django is incapable of enabling individual processes to handle multiple requests simultaneously. This puts the pressure on developers to come up with ways to make individual processes handle multiple requests efficiently.
### Difficult to learn 

One big disadvantage of Django is that it has a steep learning curve. It comes with a lot of features that cannot be easily understood by developers. This can be really tough for developers who are making a switch from other languages. Having a different syntax also makes it hard for developers to quickly get a hang of it. Python can thus be hard to master.
